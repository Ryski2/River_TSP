Data files are:
rivers_114: The original list of rivers from webscraper, removing those that are usually at water levels too low to run.
rivers_20: The list of rivers used to find our solutions detailed in the paper. 
TimeMatrix: Matrix of travel times between river indices as listed in rivers_20. Cell 1,2 is the travel time between the takeout of river 1 and the access of river 2. This was determined through the Microsoft distance matrix API.

Matlab files are all used for lp file generation. They are labeled by the project variant for which they were used to generate an lp file. 

web-s.py is the python file used to webscrape data from the whitewater database website: https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/state-summary/?state=WA
